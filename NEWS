CHANGES IN bingat VERSION 1.1

CHANGES

* Made glrtReg and glmReg functions internal since they should only be called from the glrtPvalue function. 

* Change the initial clustering in the getGibbsMixture from pam to random sampling.


BUG FIXES

* Fixed a bug in getGibbsMixture and getLoglikeMixture where large graphs would cause errors or 0 to return.

* Fixed a bug in glrtPvalue where the tau and gstar weren't being computed correctly in some instances.
